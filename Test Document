The purpose of Testing in our game is to ensure that:
  1. each block is in proper place in the array or in the box
  2. each block does not collide with another block 
  3. all methods work properly such as collision detection, rotation, and movements
  
  The test that we used in our junit test
  1) testInitialPosition
   - this checks if a block is in perfectly in the middle as soon as it respawns
   - What we do in the test is we check if each block is in the correct index in the array(board)
   
   2)testMoveDown
   -  this checks the method moveDown() if it correctly moves the block down by one row
   - what we do in the this is, we call the method moveDown()
