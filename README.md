# Tetros
Tetros
This project is for the class CPSC 233 Winter 2019 at the University of Calgary. This is specific to Winter 2019 Lecture 2 taught by Abdelghani Geurbas.
Tetros is an animation game allows players to rotate falling blocks strategically to clear through rows and gain points as they go. This is a GUI version of tetris. The graphics are displayed on the command prompt and on a pop up tab and user inputs are required to play the game.

Getting Started
To get started you will need to download the Source-code.zip file and extract the files into a folder. You will need to open up an IDE for java and 
make that folder the source folder. You must compile all the documents in the source file for the game to work. You will then go into the MainGame.java file and run that file. The game will then begin.

Prerequisites
To play this game you'll need an OS that has Java installed along with its default packages. You will need an extractor that can extract zip files
and an IDE that can run java files.

Testing
We focused on testing our Board.java file the most during our testing as it is a crucial part of the original Tetris games. Our board must be a certain size and must be able to do specific things.
